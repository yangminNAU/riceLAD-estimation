# riceLAD-estimation
An end-to-end rice canopy leaf angle distribution (LAD) estimation model based on DINOv2 model was developed.  
Through the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we fine-tuned the DINOv2 with 21,6000 images.  
We can high-throughput extract field rice LAD from UAV captured RGB images using this model.  
This is a well-trained model that can be directly used, just configure the required virtual environment.

# Model  Architecture
The model consists of two main components: a SOTA feature extraction module and a lightweight regression module.   
1) The feature extraction module uses DINOv2, an open-source visual foundation model developed by Meta AI Laboratory.
2) The feature regression module employs a classic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure.
